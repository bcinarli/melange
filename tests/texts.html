            <h1>The Battle for Endor</h1>
            <p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
            <h2>The Empire Strikes Back</h2>
            <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I call it luck. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</li>
                <li>Don't underestimate the Force.</li>
                <li>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Battle for Endor</h3>
            <p>What?! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid.

            <h4>The Sith Lords</h4>
            <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</li>
                <li>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</li>
                <li>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</li>
            </ol>

I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>

            <p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- I'm trying not to, kid. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I find your lack of faith disturbing. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
